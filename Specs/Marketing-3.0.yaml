      description: >-
        Promo Rules help you create promo codes for your campaigns. Promo Rules
        define generic information about promo codes like expiration time, start
        time, amount of discount being offered etc. For a given promo rule you
        can define if it's a percentage discount or a fixed amount and if it
        applies for the order as a whole or if it's per item or free shipping.
        You can then create promo codes for this price rule. Promo codes contain
        the actual code that is applied at checkout along with some other
        information. Price Rules have one to many relationship with promo codes.

        specific information about a promo code like the actual code,
        redemption_url, usage_count, etc that's unique to a code. Promo Code
        must be defined under a promo rule.
